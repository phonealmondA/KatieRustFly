## 🚧 Known Issues

### Compilation Blocked
**Issue:** SFML C++ libraries not installed on system
```
error: SFML/System/Clock.hpp: No such file or directory
```

**Solution:** Install SFML development libraries:
- **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
- **macOS:** `brew install sfml`
- **Windows:** Download from https://www.sfml-dev.org/

**Note:** This is expected in containerized/CI environments without graphics libraries.

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 3: Base Game Objects)

### Immediate Tasks
1. Design GameObject trait or enum system
2. Create entities/game_object.rs
3. Port Planet.h/.cpp → entities/planet.rs
4. Port Rocket.h/.cpp → entities/rocket.rs
5. Implement entity ID system for ownership management

### Key Decision
**Ownership Model:** Use Entity IDs + HashMap instead of `Rc<RefCell<>>`

```rust
pub type EntityId = usize;

pub struct World {
    planets: HashMap<EntityId, Planet>,
    rockets: HashMap<EntityId, Rocket>,
}
```

This avoids borrow checker issues with circular references.

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **lazy_static** for runtime-calculated constants (orbit distance, velocities)
2. **Module structure** with clear separation of concerns
3. **Comprehensive unit tests** with `approx` crate for float comparisons
4. **SFML bindings** provide familiar API from C++ version

### Challenges Encountered ⚠️
1. **SFML installation** required for compilation (expected)
2. **Edition 2024** in Cargo.toml (changed from default 2021)
3. **Color constants** need special handling (not const in Rust)

### Architectural Decisions 📐
1. **Entity ID pattern** chosen over Rc<RefCell<>> for simplicity
2. **GameConstants as impl** instead of namespace for Rust idioms
3. **Separate colors module** for SFML color constants

## 🎯 Key Architectural Decisions

### Entity ID Pattern (Phase 5)
Instead of raw pointers or `Rc<RefCell<>>`, we use Entity IDs:
```rust
pub type EntityId = usize;

pub struct World {
    planets: HashMap<EntityId, Planet>,
    rockets: HashMap<EntityId, Rocket>,
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No borrow checker fights
- ✅ Clear ownership
- ✅ Easy serialization
- ✅ Safe entity references

### GameObject Trait System (Phase 3)
```rust
pub trait GameObject {
    fn update(&mut self, delta_time: f32);
    fn draw(&self, window: &mut RenderWindow);
    fn position(&self) -> Vector2f;
    fn velocity(&self) -> Vector2f;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Flexible polymorphism
- ✅ Rust-idiomatic
- ✅ No virtual function overhead
