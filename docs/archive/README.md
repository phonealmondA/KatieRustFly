# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from the development process.

## What's Here

These documents were created during the C++ to Rust conversion process and contain valuable historical context, but are no longer the primary documentation.

### Development History
- **PROGRESS.md** - Detailed phase-by-phase development timeline
- **SESSION_3_SUMMARY.md** - Final development session (phases 11-16)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Complete version history across 3 sessions

### Technical References
- **CPP_TO_RUST_PATTERNS.md** - C++ to Rust translation patterns guide
- **FILE_MAPPING.md** - C++ to Rust module mapping
- **RUST_PORT_PLAN.md** - Original 16-phase conversion plan

### Analysis Documents
- **INCOMPLETE_FEATURES_ANALYSIS.md** - Feature gap analysis (pre-audit)
- **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - Future enhancement roadmap (pre-consolidation)
- **README2.md** - Original planning README

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date information, see:

- **[../../README.md](../../README.md)** - Main project documentation (accurate, reflects actual working state)
- **[../../TODO.md](../../TODO.md)** - Consolidated action items for completing feature integration

## Why Archive?

These files contained:
1. **Duplicate information** - Now consolidated in README.md and TODO.md
2. **Inaccurate claims** - Referenced features as "complete" when they exist but aren't integrated
3. **Historical development notes** - Useful for context but not for current users

They're preserved here for:
- Understanding the development process
- Historical reference
- Learning about the conversion approach
- Technical details about specific systems

## Note on Accuracy

Some archived documents (especially INCOMPLETE_FEATURES_ANALYSIS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) were written before a thorough code audit and may claim certain features are complete when they actually exist as unintegrated framework code.

Always refer to the current README.md and TODO.md for accurate status.
